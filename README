# My Ping
My Ping script written in Perl. Sends and receives ICMP packets from selected host.
It needs root privileges to run (create socket as SOCK_RAW requires that).
```
sudo perl my_ping.pl google.com
```
Run `perl -h` for help.
# Script
*script.sh* can be used to run my_ping on couple of hosts. 
To run it as it is run:
```
script.sh .config/hosts.cfg
```
You can provide many different options. You can find them by running `script.sh -h`.

Example config file is located at `.config/hosts.cfg`.
Try `./script.sh -c 2  -o out -O .config/hosts.cfg` and see the output.
